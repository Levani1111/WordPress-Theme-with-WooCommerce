This is a WordPress theme from scratch, and incorporate WooCommerce into it. You can customise it with CSS how you want.

- Using Webpack (from Laravel) for CSS and JS (With SASS)
- Creating a new WordPress theme from scratch
- Using Menus, Widgets and Post Thumbnails
- Different WordPress page templates
- Installing and Configuring WooCommerce and then making it work in the theme we developed.

I am using Webpack to combine my SASS and JS, but you do not have to use it if you do not want to. You can simply enqueue your CSS and JS directly in functions.php.
